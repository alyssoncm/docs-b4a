# How To Build a Backend for ReactJS Using Back4App

### Introduction
In this tutorial, you will build a backend for a ReactJS application using Back4App’s powerful features. You’ll combine Back4App’s real-time database, live queries, cloud code, and user authentication to create a robust foundation for your ReactJS front end. By leveraging Parse Server on Back4App, you can offload complex infrastructure tasks—like managing servers and databases—while focusing on building your React application’s functionality.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional backend on Back4App that your ReactJS app can consume via the Parse JavaScript SDK (or REST and GraphQL APIs if you prefer). You’ll also explore how to secure your data using Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Class-Level Permissions (CLPs). Additionally, you’ll integrate common features such as file storage, email verification, password resets, and scheduled tasks using Cloud Jobs. After completing the steps below, you will be equipped to extend this foundation to production-grade applications, integrate third-party services through webhooks, and tap into many additional capabilities that Back4App offers.

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, ensure you have the following requirements and resources in place:

- **A Back4App account**  
  If you don’t have an account, [sign up for free on Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/).

- **A new Back4App project**  
  You can follow our [Getting Started with Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/docs/get-started/new-back4app-app) guide to create a fresh project.

- **Local development environment for React**  
  Make sure you have Node.js (version 14 or above is recommended) and npm (or Yarn) installed.  
  - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven’t already.  
  - If you’re new to React, you can review [React Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) for a quick introduction.

- **Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React**  
  Familiarity with ES6+ syntax (imports, exports, arrow functions) and how React components work will be helpful.

- **Basic knowledge of HTTP APIs**  
  This tutorial will briefly touch on REST and GraphQL concepts. Although we provide code examples, a basic understanding of API calls is useful.

Having these prerequisites in place ensures you can follow each step smoothly. Let’s get started by creating your new Back4App project and connecting it with your React application.



## Step 1 – Creating a New Project on Back4App and Connecting

In this first step, you will create a new Back4App project, obtain your keys, and install the Parse SDK for your React application. This forms the foundation of your backend configuration.

1. **Create a New Project on Back4App**  
   1. Log in to your Back4App account.  
   2. Click the “Create New App” button (sometimes labeled “New App”) in your dashboard.  
   3. Provide a project name (for example, **ReactBackendDemo**) and select a server location if prompted.  
   4. Click “Create” or “Proceed” to finalize your project creation.  

   You will now see your newly created project in the Back4App dashboard. This blank project is what we’ll configure throughout this tutorial.

2. **Retrieve Your App Credentials**  
   - In your project’s dashboard, look for **App Settings** or **App Credentials**.  
   - Locate your **Application ID** and **Javascript Key** (also known as the Client Key in some contexts).  
   - Keep your **Master Key** private; you typically won’t expose this in your React app.  

3. **Install the Parse SDK in Your React Project**  
   Next, you’ll integrate the Parse JavaScript SDK into your React application. If you haven’t created a React app yet, run the following command in your terminal to bootstrap a new project (using Create React App as an example):

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app react-backend-demo
   cd react-backend-demo
   ```

   Now install the `parse` library:

   ```bash
   npm install parse
   ```

4. **Initialize Parse in Your React App**  
   Open the `src/App.js` (or create a dedicated file such as `parseConfig.js`) and initialize Parse using your Back4App credentials. For instance:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
   import Parse from 'parse';

   function App() {
     useEffect(() => {
       // Initialize Parse
       Parse.initialize(
         'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
         'YOUR_JAVASCRIPT_KEY'
       );
       Parse.serverURL = 'https://parseapi.back4app.com/';
     }, []);

     return (
       <div className="App">
         <h1>Welcome to React + Back4App</h1>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_ID` and `YOUR_JAVASCRIPT_KEY` with the values from your Back4App dashboard. Make sure the `Parse.serverURL` is set to `https://parseapi.back4app.com/`.

**Transition**  
You’ve just set up a new Back4App project and connected it to a React application. This initial connection allows you to read and write data, authenticate users, and leverage additional Back4App features. Next, we’ll set up your database schema and explore various ways to interact with data (Parse SDK, REST, GraphQL, and Live Queries).

---

## Step 2 – Setting Up the Database

In this step, you will create and manage your data model on Back4App, exploring several ways to read and write data. This is a crucial step because your application’s logic will typically revolve around data storage and retrieval.

### 1. Creating a Data Model

A data model defines how data is structured in your database. For our example, let’s say you’re building a simple “To-Do” application. You might have a class called `Task` with fields such as `title` (string) and `isComplete` (boolean).

1. **In Your Back4App Dashboard**  
   - Navigate to your project and click **Database** in the left sidebar.  
   - Click **Create a class**.  
   - Name it `Task` and select **Create an empty class**.  
   - Click **Create class**.  

   You’ll now see the `Task` class in your database browser.  

2. **Adding Columns (Fields)**  
   - Within the `Task` class, click **Add a new column**.  
   - Name the column `title` and set its type to **String**.  
   - Add another column named `isComplete` of type **Boolean**.

Your data model is now ready to store tasks. Each `Task` object in the database will have a `title` and an `isComplete` flag.

### 2. Creating a Data Model Using the Back4App AI Agent
Back4App offers an AI-driven feature to help you quickly create data models. You can describe your data requirements, and the AI Agent will generate a recommended schema:

1. **Open the AI Agent (if enabled on your account)**  
   - From the Back4App dashboard, look for the **AI Agent** or **AI Data Model** option in your Database section.  
   - Provide a brief description such as “Create a class `Task` with a `title` (string) and `isComplete` (boolean).”  
   - The AI agent will suggest a schema, which you can accept or edit.

This can speed up schema creation, especially for complex data models.

### 3. Reading and Writing Data Using the Parse SDK (React)

Now that you have a basic `Task` class, let’s see how to create and retrieve data from your React code.

1. **Saving Data**  
   In your React app, you might have a form to create a new task. Here’s an example of how to save data using the Parse SDK:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from 'react';
   import Parse from 'parse';

   function TaskCreator() {
     const [title, setTitle] = useState('');

     const handleSaveTask = async () => {
       const Task = Parse.Object.extend('Task');
       const task = new Task();
       task.set('title', title);
       task.set('isComplete', false);

       try {
         await task.save();
         alert('Task saved successfully!');
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error while saving task:', error);
       }
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <input
           type="text"
           placeholder="Task Title"
           value={title}
           onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}
         />
         <button onClick={handleSaveTask}>Create Task</button>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default TaskCreator;
   ```

   **Explanation**:  
   - `Parse.Object.extend('Task')` references the `Task` class you created.  
   - `task.set('title', title)` and `task.set('isComplete', false)` set the object’s properties.  
   - `task.save()` asynchronously saves data to the Back4App database.  

2. **Querying Data**  
   To read data, use the `Parse.Query` object:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   import Parse from 'parse';

   function TaskList() {
     const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

     useEffect(() => {
       const fetchTasks = async () => {
         const Task = Parse.Object.extend('Task');
         const query = new Parse.Query(Task);
         // Optional: query.equalTo('isComplete', false);
         try {
           const results = await query.find();
           setTasks(results);
         } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error while fetching tasks:', error);
         }
       };

       fetchTasks();
     }, []);

     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Tasks</h2>
         <ul>
           {tasks.map((task) => (
             <li key={task.id}>
               {task.get('title')} - 
               {task.get('isComplete') ? 'Complete' : 'Incomplete'}
             </li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default TaskList;
   ```

   **Explanation**:  
   - `Parse.Query(Task)` lets you build queries against the `Task` class.  
   - `query.find()` returns an array of objects that match the query.  
   - Each returned object provides methods like `get('fieldName')` to access data.

### 4. Reading and Writing Data Using the REST API

Alternatively, Back4App lets you interact with your database using REST endpoints. This is useful when you cannot use the Parse SDK directly or need an HTTP-based approach.

- **Save (POST)**  
  To save a new `Task` object, make a POST request to `https://parseapi.back4app.com/classes/Task` with the required headers and JSON body:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: YOUR_REST_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"New Task via REST","isComplete":false}' \
  https://parseapi.back4app.com/classes/Task
  ```

- **Retrieve (GET)**  
  To fetch a list of tasks:

  ```bash
  curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID" \
  -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: YOUR_REST_API_KEY" \
  https://parseapi.back4app.com/classes/Task
  ```

In a React environment, you could use `fetch` or `axios`:

```javascript
async function fetchTasksREST() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      'https://parseapi.back4app.com/classes/Task',
      {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
          'X-Parse-Application-Id': 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID',
          'X-Parse-REST-API-Key': 'YOUR_REST_API_KEY',
        },
      }
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data.results);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('REST fetch error:', error);
  }
}
```

### 5. Reading and Writing Data Using the GraphQL API

Back4App also supports GraphQL, which can be convenient for more efficient data querying, especially in complex front-end applications.

- **Schema**  
  By default, Parse automatically creates a GraphQL schema for your classes. You can explore it by going to `https://parseapi.back4app.com/graphql` (if enabled in your Back4App project).

- **Query Example**  
  A simple GraphQL query to list tasks might look like:

  ```graphql
  query {
    tasks {
      edges {
        node {
          objectId
          title
          isComplete
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Mutation Example**  
  To create a new task:

  ```graphql
  mutation {
    createTask(fields: { title: "My GraphQL Task", isComplete: false }) {
      objectId
      title
      isComplete
    }
  }
  ```

In React, you could use any GraphQL library (such as Apollo Client) to make these requests, passing your Back4App credentials in the headers.

### 6. Working with Live Queries (Optional)

Live Queries enable real-time updates in your React app. For instance, when a task changes status, all connected clients immediately see that update.

1. **Enabling Live Queries in Back4App**  
   - In the Back4App dashboard, go to **Server Settings**.  
   - Make sure “Live Queries” is enabled for the classes you want to watch (e.g., `Task`).  

2. **Using Live Queries in React**  
   Install `live-query-utils` or a relevant tool, or handle it directly from Parse:

   ```javascript
   import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   import Parse from 'parse';

   function LiveQueryTaskList() {
     const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

     useEffect(() => {
       const Task = Parse.Object.extend('Task');
       const query = new Parse.Query(Task);

       query.subscribe().then((subscription) => {
         subscription.on('open', () => {
           console.log('Live Query subscription opened.');
         });

         subscription.on('create', (createdTask) => {
           setTasks((prevTasks) => [...prevTasks, createdTask]);
         });

         subscription.on('update', (updatedTask) => {
           setTasks((prevTasks) =>
             prevTasks.map((task) =>
               task.id === updatedTask.id ? updatedTask : task
             )
           );
         });

         // Add other event handlers: enter, leave, delete, etc.
       });

       // Initial fetch
       const fetchTasks = async () => {
         const results = await query.find();
         setTasks(results);
       };
       fetchTasks();
     }, []);

     return (
       <ul>
         {tasks.map((task) => (
           <li key={task.id}>
             {task.get('title')} - {task.get('isComplete') ? 'Complete' : 'Incomplete'}
           </li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     );
   }

   export default LiveQueryTaskList;
   ```

With Live Queries, your React UI remains up-to-date without manual polling.

**Transition**  
At this point, you’ve set up a functional database schema, learned multiple ways to interact with your data, and even explored real-time updates via Live Queries. Next, we’ll apply security measures such as Access Control Lists and Class-Level Permissions to restrict who can read or write data.

---

## Step 3 – Applying Security with ACLs and CLPs

Security is paramount in any production app. Back4App provides Access Control Lists (ACLs) for per-object security and Class-Level Permissions (CLPs) for broader rules at the class level.

1. **Brief Overview**  
   - **ACL**: Lets you define which users or roles can read or write a specific object.  
   - **CLP**: Lets you define read/write permissions at the class level, controlling whether the public can create objects, whether only logged-in users can read, etc.

2. **Setting Up Class-Level Permissions in the Dashboard**  
   1. Go to the Back4App dashboard and navigate to **Database** > **Security**.  
   2. Select the `Task` class (or whichever class you want to secure).  
   3. You can configure **Public Read**, **Public Write**, or require users to be authenticated.  
   4. You can also restrict creation, querying, or deletion.  

3. **Configuring ACLs in Code**  
   When creating or updating an object, you can set ACLs programmatically:

   ```javascript
   const Task = Parse.Object.extend('Task');
   const task = new Task();

   const acl = new Parse.ACL();
//   acl.setPublicReadAccess(false);
//   acl.setPublicWriteAccess(false);

   // Only let the current user read/write:
   acl.setReadAccess(Parse.User.current(), true);
   acl.setWriteAccess(Parse.User.current(), true);

   task.setACL(acl);
   task.set('title', 'My secure task');
   task.set('isComplete', false);
   await task.save();
   ```

This ensures only the current logged-in user can read or modify the object.

**Transition**  
Now that your classes and objects are secured, you can confidently store sensitive data. In the next section, we’ll explore Cloud Code, which lets you add server-side logic (triggers, validations, and business rules) without spinning up an external server.

---

## Step 4 – Writing Cloud Code Functions

Cloud Code allows you to implement server-side functions, triggers (beforeSave, afterSave, etc.), and validations. This is useful for logic that shouldn’t reside in the client, such as sending push notifications, adjusting data before saving, or integrating with external APIs.

1. **Why Cloud Code**  
   Typical use cases include:
   - Running custom validation before saving data.  
   - Sending notifications when a certain event occurs (e.g., a user completes a task).  
   - Integrating with external APIs in a secure environment (e.g., payment gateways).

2. **Example Function**  
   Let’s create a simple Cloud Code function to mark a task as complete:

   ```javascript
   Parse.Cloud.define('markTaskComplete', async (request) => {
     const { taskId } = request.params;
     const Task = Parse.Object.extend('Task');
     const query = new Parse.Query(Task);
     try {
       const task = await query.get(taskId);
       task.set('isComplete', true);
       await task.save();
       return `Task with ID ${taskId} was marked complete.`;
     } catch (error) {
       throw new Error(`Cannot mark task complete: ${error.message}`);
     }
   });
   ```

   **Explanation**:  
   - `request.params.taskId` is passed from the client.  
   - We fetch the task, set `isComplete` to `true`, and save.  
   - If successful, we return a confirmation message; otherwise, we throw an error.

3. **Deployment**  
   1. In the Back4App dashboard, locate **Cloud Code** in the left panel.  
   2. Open your `main.js` (or whichever file is designated for your Cloud Code).  
   3. Paste your function.  
   4. Click **Deploy** or **Push** changes.  

4. **Calling Cloud Code from React**  
   You can invoke this function from your React application using the `Parse.Cloud.run` method:

   ```javascript
   import Parse from 'parse';

   async function markTaskAsComplete(taskId) {
     try {
       const result = await Parse.Cloud.run('markTaskComplete', { taskId });
       console.log(result);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error calling markTaskComplete:', error);
     }
   }
   ```

5. **NPM Modules in Cloud Code**  
   You can also add external NPM packages to your Cloud Code environment:

   1. Under **Cloud Code** in your Back4App dashboard, go to **Cloud Code Settings**.  
   2. Specify the packages you need under **package.json**.  
   3. Deploy again so your changes take effect.

**Transition**  
You’ve now seen how to implement custom server-side logic using Cloud Code. Next, we’ll turn our attention to user management: configuring authentication, signing up and logging in users, and even adding social logins.

---

## Step 5 – Configuring Authentication

User authentication is essential for any modern app. Parse (and thus Back4App) supports robust user management out of the box.

1. **Enable User Class and Basic Settings**  
   - In your Back4App dashboard, you’ll typically see a default `_User` class. This is where all user data is stored.  
   - You can set some Class-Level Permissions to restrict user creation, querying, or update capabilities.

2. **Sign Up, Log In, Log Out**  
   Below is a basic example of how to manage users in React with the Parse SDK.

   ```javascript
   import Parse from 'parse';

   // Sign up
   async function signUpUser(username, password, email) {
     const user = new Parse.User();
     user.set('username', username);
     user.set('password', password);
     user.set('email', email);

     try {
       const signedUpUser = await user.signUp();
       console.log('User signed up', signedUpUser);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error signing up:', error);
     }
   }

   // Log in
   async function logInUser(username, password) {
     try {
       const user = await Parse.User.logIn(username, password);
       console.log('Logged in user:', user);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error logging in:', error);
     }
   }

   // Log out
   async function logOutUser() {
     try {
       await Parse.User.logOut();
       console.log('User logged out');
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error logging out:', error);
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Social Login**  
   Back4App supports third-party logins (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.). You configure these providers in your Back4App dashboard (under **Auth Providers**). Then, in your app, you can call methods such as `Parse.User._linkWith(...)` or use specialized Parse functionality for each provider. Please refer to [Back4App’s Social Login documentation](https://www.back4app.com/docs/security-and-privacy/users/linking-a-user-to-oauth-providers) for detailed steps.

**Transition**  
You now have user authentication set up. Next, let’s explore how to handle file uploads and retrieval in Back4App, which can store images, documents, or any other file type your React app may need.

---

## Step 6 – Handling File Storage

Back4App’s file storage allows you to manage files in a scalable manner, automatically assigning a globally accessible URL. This is helpful for images, documents, or other assets you may need to associate with your data.

1. **Setting Up File Storage**  
   - File storage is typically enabled by default in Back4App.  
   - Check your project’s **App Settings** or **Server Settings** to confirm that file storage is active.

2. **Upload an Image Example**  
   Suppose you want users to upload profile pictures. Here’s how to do it in React:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from 'react';
   import Parse from 'parse';

   function FileUploader() {
     const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);

     const handleFileChange = (event) => {
       setSelectedFile(event.target.files[0]);
     };

     const handleUpload = async () => {
       if (!selectedFile) return;

       const parseFile = new Parse.File(selectedFile.name, selectedFile);
       try {
         const savedFile = await parseFile.save();
         console.log('File uploaded:', savedFile.url());
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
       }
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />
         <button onClick={handleUpload}>Upload File</button>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default FileUploader;
   ```

   **Explanation**:  
   - `new Parse.File(selectedFile.name, selectedFile)` creates a Parse file object.  
   - `parseFile.save()` uploads the file to Back4App’s storage.  
   - `savedFile.url()` gives you a public URL for that file.

3. **Security Considerations**  
   - By default, uploaded files are publicly accessible by their URL.  
   - You can limit file access with Cloud Code or by storing references in restricted classes.

**Transition**  
With file storage integrated, your React application can handle user-uploaded content seamlessly. Next, let’s add essential user management features like email verification and password reset.

---

## Step 7 – Email Verification and Password Reset

Ensuring valid email addresses and offering password reset functionality is crucial for maintaining user trust and security.

1. **Why Verify Emails and Provide Password Reset**  
   - Validating email addresses helps confirm user identities and reduce spam or fraudulent sign-ups.  
   - Password reset capabilities are standard in modern applications for better UX and security.

2. **Back4App Dashboard Configuration**  
   1. Go to **App Settings** > **Email Settings** (or similar).  
   2. Enable **Email Verification** to require users to verify their email after sign-up.  
   3. Enable **Password Reset** to allow the system to send reset instructions.  
   4. You can customize the email templates with your branding, text, and links.

3. **Code Example**  
   - **Request Password Reset** in React:

     ```javascript
     import Parse from 'parse';

     async function requestPasswordReset(email) {
       try {
         await Parse.User.requestPasswordReset(email);
         alert('Password reset instructions sent to ' + email);
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error requesting password reset:', error);
       }
     }
     ```

   - **Email Verification** is automatically handled once the user signs up, as Parse will send a verification email if enabled in your dashboard.

**Transition**  
Your user flow is now more polished. Let’s move on to automating repetitive tasks using Cloud Jobs—useful for cleaning up outdated records, sending periodic emails, or other scheduled processes.

## Step 8 – Scheduling Tasks with Cloud Jobs

Cloud Jobs let you schedule tasks to run at a specific time or interval. They are perfect for automating backend tasks (e.g., sending weekly reports, archiving old data).

1. **What Cloud Jobs Do**  
   Cloud Jobs are basically Cloud Code functions with a scheduling mechanism in the Back4App dashboard. They run on the server side without user interaction.

2. **Example: A Daily Clean-Up Job**  
   Let’s say you want to archive tasks older than 30 days:

   ```javascript
   Parse.Cloud.job('archiveOldTasks', async (request) => {
     const Task = Parse.Object.extend('Task');
     const query = new Parse.Query(Task);

     // Calculate date 30 days ago
     const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date();
     thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30);

     query.lessThan('createdAt', thirtyDaysAgo);

     try {
       const oldTasks = await query.find();
       for (const task of oldTasks) {
         task.set('archived', true);
         await task.save(null, { useMasterKey: true });
       }
       return `Archived ${oldTasks.length} tasks.`;
     } catch (error) {
       throw new Error(`Error archiving tasks: ${error.message}`);
     }
   });
   ```

   **Deployment**:  
   - Add this job to your `main.js` in Cloud Code.  
   - Deploy your changes.

3. **Scheduling the Job**  
   - Go to **Cloud Jobs** in the Back4App dashboard.  
   - Find `archiveOldTasks` and schedule it (e.g., to run daily at midnight).  

**Transition**  
With Cloud Jobs, you’ve automated tasks to run without manual intervention. Next, we’ll explore webhooks, which let your backend call external services whenever certain events or triggers occur.

---

## Step 9 – Integrating Webhooks

Webhooks extend your app’s capabilities by sending HTTP requests to external URLs in response to specific events. For instance, you can notify a third-party service each time a new task is created.

1. **Definition**  
   - A **webhook** is a user-defined HTTP callback that triggers when an event happens on your server (e.g., creation of a database object).

2. **Configuration**  
   - In the Back4App dashboard, navigate to **Webhooks** or **Integrations**.  
   - Define a new webhook with a target URL (e.g., `https://example.com/webhook-endpoint`).  
   - Specify which event triggers the webhook (e.g., an object in the `Task` class is created or updated).

3. **Example Use Case**  
   - Suppose you integrate with Slack or Stripe. When a user completes a task, you can fire a webhook to Slack to notify your team.

   **Server-Side Implementation** (using Cloud Code triggers):
   ```javascript
   Parse.Cloud.afterSave('Task', async (request) => {
     if (request.object.get('isComplete')) {
       // If it's complete, call an external API or rely on a configured webhook
       // Example: Send a POST request to Slack
       // Or let the B4A Webhook do it automatically if configured
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Transition**  
Webhooks help you integrate with external ecosystems and microservices. Finally, let’s see how the Back4App Admin Panel ties all these features together for easier management.

## Step 10 – Exploring the Back4App Admin Panel

The Back4App Admin Panel is your single-pane-of-glass for managing data, monitoring logs, scheduling tasks, viewing analytics, and more.

1. **Where to Find It**  
   - Log in to your Back4App account and select your project.  
   - On the left sidebar, you will see multiple sections: **Database**, **Cloud Code**, **Security**, **Cloud Jobs**, **Logs**, **Analytics**, etc.

2. **Key Features**  
   - **Database**: View, edit, or delete records in any class.  
   - **Logs**: Monitor application logs, Cloud Code logs, and error logs to debug issues.  
   - **Background Jobs**: Manage and schedule Cloud Jobs.  
   - **Push Notifications** (if relevant to your plan): Send real-time notifications to users.  
   - **Analytics**: Track usage metrics like requests, API hits, etc.

3. **Transition / Final Step**  
After exploring the Admin Panel, you can confidently deploy your React + Back4App application to production. Let’s wrap up and discuss potential next steps.

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive tutorial, you created a secure, feature-rich backend for a ReactJS application using Back4App. You configured a new Back4App project, set up a database schema, wrote code to handle data via the Parse SDK, REST, GraphQL, and Live Queries, and ensured security with ACLs and CLPs. You then extended the functionality with Cloud Code, user authentication, file storage, email verification, and password resets. Finally, you explored scheduling tasks with Cloud Jobs, integrating webhooks for external services, and working with the Back4App Admin Panel for overall project management.

By accomplishing these steps, you’ve gained practical skills in:

- Spinning up a **Back4App** project for use in React applications.  
- **Modeling** and **interacting** with data in multiple ways (SDK, REST, GraphQL).  
- Implementing **real-time** updates with Live Queries.  
- Applying **security** best practices (ACLs, CLPs).  
- Writing and deploying **Cloud Code** for custom backend logic.  
- Managing **user authentication**, social logins, and user security workflows.  
- Handling **file storage** in a scalable manner.
